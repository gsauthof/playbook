## Content

- `fedora/rescue-stick` - scripts that install [Fedora][f] on a raw
  disk, e.g. on a USB mass storage device, with a configuration
  suitable for system administration tasks (think: repairing a
  broken system, rescuing data, initiating installations,
  diagnosing network issues, ...).

See also the README.md files in the subdirectories.
