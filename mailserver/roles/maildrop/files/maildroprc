# Maildrop starts a shell for _each_ external command such as a filter
# The maildrop default is the user's login shell.
# Using bash is arguably a better default for users - especially ones
# with exotic shells - and because it's arguably less surprising.
# Using bash also simplifies writing a SELinux policy for maildrop.
